	<h1 class="post-title">Simplex-based optimization in spherical coordinates</h1>
	<span class="post-date">Sun 16 June 2019</span>
	<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>For gradient-free optimization of an objective (scalar) function,
simplex based algorithms are a popular choice. In particular the
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/7.4.308">Nelder-Mead method</a> is widely used for local
optimization and also serves as the example in this article, other
variants include the controlled random search (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00933504">CRS</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10957-006-9101-0">CRS2</a>) or Constrained Optimization by Linear Approximations
(<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-015-8330-5_4">COBYLA</a>) for global optimization. The probably most defining
feature of simplex methods is the creation of new trial points by
reflection of a point about the centroid of another set of points.</p>
<p>Standard implementations of these algorithms perform the operations
assuming that the <span class="math">\(n\)</span>-dimensional parameter space of the objective
function is Euclidean. However, if our parameter space is of
non-Euclidean nature, such as the surface of a sphere, the standard
assumptions break down.</p>
<p>Here we will discuss how to correctly adapt the Nelder-Mead algorithm to
work with spherical coordinates in three dimensions. Our coordinate
system choice is given in Eq. [eq:coord], with the spherical
coordinates <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\varphi\)</span> representing the zenith and azimuth
angles, and their representation in cartesian coordinates <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math">\(y\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(z\)</span> on the unit sphere.</p>
<div class="math">$$\begin{aligned}
\begin{split}
\begin{cases}
x=\sin\theta \, \cos\varphi \\
y=\sin\theta \, \sin\varphi \\
z=\cos\theta
\end{cases}
\end{split}
\label{eq:coord}\end{aligned}$$</div>
<h1>Nelder-Mead Algorithm</h1>
<p>In abbreviated form, a “vanilla” Nelder-Mead algorithm minimizing the
function <span class="math">\(f\)</span> repeatedly performs the following operations on <span class="math">\(n+1\)</span>
points (the simplex) in <span class="math">\(n\)</span> dimensions, until a desired convergence
criterion is met.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Order all points <span class="math">\(p\)</span> by their function values <span class="math">\(f(p)\)</span>, such that
    <span class="math">\(f(p_1) \leq f(p_2) \leq \cdots \leq f(p_{n+1})\)</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Calculate the centroid <span class="math">\(c\)</span> of the <span class="math">\(n\)</span> points <span class="math">\(p_1 \cdots p_n\)</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a new trial point <span class="math">\(\bar{p}_{n+1}\)</span> by reflecting point
    <span class="math">\(p_{n+1}\)</span> about the centroid <span class="math">\(c\)</span>, if <span class="math">\(f(p_1) \leq f(\bar{p}_{n+1}) &lt; f(p_n)\)</span>, accept the new
    point replacing <span class="math">\(p_{n+1}\)</span> and start over (Step 1)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If <span class="math">\(f(\bar{p}_{n+1}) &lt; f(p_1)\)</span>, expand the new point further
    away on the line connecting it back to the centroid (usually factor
    2x, i.e. the distance of the original point to the centroid is the
    same as the distance from the centroid to the expanded point), if
    this new point is better then the reflected one, accept the new
    point replacing <span class="math">\(p_{n+1}\)</span> and start over (Step 1), otherwise accept
    the reflected point and start over</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a new trial point that is the mid-point between <span class="math">\(p_{n+1}\)</span> and
    <span class="math">\(c\)</span>, if its function value is better than that of <span class="math">\(p_{n+1}\)</span>, us the
    new point as replacement and start over</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shrink all points, except for the best point <span class="math">\(p_1\)</span>, by replacing
    them by their midpoint towards <span class="math">\(p_1\)</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1>Adaption to Spherical Coordinates</h1>
<p>One might be tempted to use a standard implementation of Nelder-Mead
operating directly on <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\varphi\)</span>, and applying a “fix” by
simply assuring that the points outside of <span class="math">\(\varphi \in [0,2\pi)\)</span> are
handled by “wrapping around” azimuth by <span class="math">\(\varphi = \varphi \mod 2\pi\)</span>.
Similarly, zenith values falling outside of <span class="math">\(\theta \in [0,\pi)\)</span> can be
reflecting back at the edges. We will use this approach as comparison
labeled as the “naive” method in the following.</p>
<p>For our “correct” Nelder-Mead algorithm, we will use the method
described in the follwoing.</p>
<h2 id="sec:centroid">Centroid Calculation</h2>
<p>In order to calculated the centroid of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> points (Step 2) given their
spherical coordinates
<span class="math">\((\theta_1, \varphi_1), (\theta_2, \varphi_2), \dots (\theta_n, \varphi_n)\)</span>,
we will resort to their representation in cartesian coordinates. We can
then simply calculate the centroid (element-wise average) in <span class="math">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math">\(y\)</span>
and <span class="math">\(z\)</span>, normalize to assure <span class="math">\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1\)</span>, and subsequently
transform back to spherical coordinates to obtain the centroit in zenith
and azimuth.</p>
<p>Also the operations in steps 5 &amp; 6, where the midpoint of two points has
to be determined, can use the same as it is essentially the centroid of
two points.</p>
<h2 id="sec:reflection">Point Reflection</h2>
<p>Calculating point reflections (Step 3) is slightly more involved, but
does not pose any serious problem either. Assuming we want to reflect a
point <span class="math">\(p\)</span> around the centroid <span class="math">\((\theta_c, \varphi_c)\)</span> into a new point
<span class="math">\(\bar{p}\)</span>, we first transform our coordinate system so, that the
centroid comes to lie at the North Pole of the unit sphere. This is
achieved by a rotation <span class="math">\(R_z^T(\phi_c)\)</span> about the <span class="math">\(z\)</span>-axis such that our
centroid point will be on the <span class="math">\(x-z\)</span> plane. Then we rotate around the <span class="math">\(y\)</span>
axis by a rotation <span class="math">\(R_y^T(\theta_c)\)</span>, which brings the centroid to the
desired location. In these coordinates, reflections about the centroid
(now at the North Pole), are as simple as inverting the <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span>
dimensions of a point in its Cartesian representation. After this, we
transform back into the original representation by un-doing both
rotations in the correct order. The full operation is shown in
Eq. [eq:reflection] for a point <span class="math">\(p\)</span> in its Cartesian representation.</p>
<div class="math">$$\begin{aligned}
\begin{split}
\boldsymbol{\bar{p}} &amp;= R_z(\varphi_c) \cdot R_y(\theta_c) \cdot \mathrm{diag}(-1,-1,1) \cdot R_y^T(\theta_c) \cdot R_z^T(\varphi_c) \cdot \boldsymbol{p}\\
&amp;= 
\begin{pmatrix} 
c_\varphi (-c_\varphi c_\theta^2 + c_\varphi s_\theta^2) - s_\varphi^2 &amp; c_\varphi s_\varphi + s_\varphi (-c_\varphi c_\theta^2 + c_\varphi s_\theta^2) &amp;   2 c_\varphi c_\theta s_\theta \\
c_\varphi s_\varphi + c_\varphi (-s_\varphi c_\theta^2 + s_\varphi s_\theta^2) &amp; -c_\varphi^2 + s_\varphi (-s_\varphi c_\theta^2  + s_\varphi s_\theta^2) &amp;    2 s_\varphi c_\theta s_\theta \\
2 c_\varphi c_\theta s_\theta &amp; 2 s_\varphi c_\theta s_\theta &amp; c_\theta^2 - s_\theta^2    \\      
\end{pmatrix}
\cdot \boldsymbol{p}, \textrm{where} 
\begin{cases}
c_\varphi = \cos{\varphi_c}\\
s_\varphi = \sin{\varphi_c}\\
c_\theta = \cos{\theta_c}\\
s_\theta = \sin{\theta_c}
\end{cases}
\label{eq:reflection}
\end{split}\end{aligned}$$</div>
<p>Also Step 4 can be calculated as another reflection of the centroid <span class="math">\(c\)</span>
about point <span class="math">\(\bar{p}_{n+1}\)</span>.</p>
<p>In Fig. 1 we illustrate the difference of performing the two
discussed operations (centroid and reflection) in the naive way directly
on <span class="math">\((\theta, \varphi)\)</span>, and the correct way using the prescriptions
discussed above. It is evident that the two method can yield very
different results.</p>

<h1>Performance</h1>
<p>We have now all necessary pieces to run a “correct” Nelder-Mead
optimization on spherical coordinates. To illustrated the differences
between this and the “naive” approach, we choose the spherical harmonic
of degree <span class="math">\((1,1)\)</span> to serve as our objective function. In one example we
place the function minimum in the middle of the <span class="math">\((\theta, \varphi)\)</span>
plane at <span class="math">\((\pi, \pi/2)\)</span>, in the second example we add an azimuthal phase
shift of <span class="math">\(\pi\)</span> such that the minimum comes to lie at the edge at
<span class="math">\((0, \pi/2)\)</span>, creating two extreme cases.</p>
<p>In Fig. 2, we show one run of both algorithms on the two
example problems, while starting from the same initial simplex. In the
case of the minimum conveniently located right in the middle of the
<span class="math">\((\theta, \varphi)\)</span> plane, both algorithms converge toward the minimum
taking a similar amount of function calls until the stopping condition
is reached. The used stopping conditions is the standard deviation of
the function values <span class="math">\(f(p_i)\)</span> of all current simplex points <span class="math">\(p_i\)</span> must
drop below a set threshold, here <span class="math">\(\mathrm{std}(f(p_i)) &lt; 0.00001\)</span>. In
the phase shifted case, the correct algorithm has no problem finding the
true minimum again. But now the naive implementation does not converge
to the correct minimum and gets stuck.</p>

</figure>
<p>We next run on the same two examples with randomized initial simplex
points, uniformly distributed over the surface of the unit sphere, for
100,000 times. Figure 3 shows the number of function calls
that were needed to reach the stopping condition. For the first problem
both implementations perform similarly, with the “correct” one needing
slightly fewer function calls. They both also converge to the true
minimum as shown in Fig. 4.</p>
<p>For the second problem, we can see that not only does it need many more
function calls to reach convergence (nearly an order of magnitude more),
but also does the naive algorithm not find the minimum in most cases.
The behaviour of the correct implementation, however, is virtually
unchanged between both problems—as expected.</p>

<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>For a non-Euclidean parameter space of a function that needs to be
minimized, special care must be taken for the operations of simplex
based optimizes. In particular, the calculation of midpoints and
reflections need to be correctly adapted. While in some cases a standard
implementation can work, it will exhibit a dependence on the choice of
the orientation of the coordinate system, which is a very undesirable
behaviour. Adapting the algorithm correctly however removed such
dependencies naturally, and also performs at least as good and fast or
better. Similar adaptations for different coordinate systems can be made
in analogy.</p>
